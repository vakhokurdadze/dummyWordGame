# dummyWordGame
kotlin , dummy word game (user + bot)

Regarding the game:

Dummy Word Application is a simple, funny game, through which you try to beat the robot by memorising as much
words as possible. The robot seems quite tough, so be prepared! Good luck!

Project is consisted of two applications, the bot (com.adjarabet.bot) and user (com.adjarabet.user).
In The project you are able to build and run both of the applications. bot application has no user interface
while the user app is the one that visualizes the game. 

To play with a bot you need to first install bot application on your device or emulator and then intall the user
app. As soon as you open the user application, welcome screen appears in front of you. On the welcome screen you
have two options to start the game. Either you select that you start the game or you prefer the bot to start the match.
If you do not select none of the field and press start button then message pops up indicating that you have to select one
of the options. As soon as one of the players lose the game the dialog pops up which says information regarding the winner
and match details and suggests whether you want to play again or go to welcome page. Enjoy the game!
